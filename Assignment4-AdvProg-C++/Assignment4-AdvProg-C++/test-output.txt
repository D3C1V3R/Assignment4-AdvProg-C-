the game of life written by ian sharpe the game of life was invented by the mathematician john conway and first reached a wide public when it was written up in scientific american in or thereabouts in those days it was mostly played on squared paper nowadays computers take all the hard work out of this fascinating invention to some it's nothing more than a toy to others it and related cellular automata are subjects for serious study in this implementation the screen is divided into a grid of cells wide by deep a cell may be live (red or dead (white) you begin by creating the first generation of live cells or seed use the cursor keys to move the cursor and the spacebar to toggle a cell between live and dead press [return] and the program will quickly create successive generations of cells a new generation is created by scanning every cell and counting up the number of live neighbours a neighbour is classed as the eight cells that border horizontally vertically and diagonally the cell under scrutiny is live or dead in the next generation according to the following rules none or one live neighbour dies of loneliness two live neighbours stays in the same state as it is now three live neighbours lives in the next generation four or more live neighbours dies of suffocation when every cell on the screen has had its state assessed and made live or dead according to the rules the new generation is complete and the process repeats
